# How to run the code 
These code have been tested in `Linux` and `Android`. 
+ In `Linux`, the code should compile with `gcc`.
+ In `Android`, the code should be compile with `arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -static`.

# Files
+ Setup time in the `result.md` is got by `*_setup.c` (run in Android).
+ Average passowrd generation time in the `result.md` is got by `*_key_gen.c` (run in Android).
+ Average verification time in the `result.md` is the average of Setup time (run in Linux).
